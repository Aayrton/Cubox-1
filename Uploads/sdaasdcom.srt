Are you eating
cookie dough?

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,999
Yup. It's my favorite recipe.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,435
All you need
is cookie dough and weed.

5
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,238
So the only thing
you have to bake is yourself.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,739
It's very efficient.

7
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,009
It causes the munchies
and then immediately cures them.

Hey.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,646
What do you know?
They found my car.

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,114
You lost your car?

What the hell's your
cookie dough laced with?

12
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:28,018
No, I found this company

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,021
and they help you
locate old vehicles.

Dude, Where's My Car?

So what's so great
about this thing?

16
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:38,362
I don't know. It's my first car.
I got a lot of firsts in it.

17
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:40,030
First time I learned to drive.

18
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:42,666
First time I had sex.

19
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,635
First time I had a condom break.

20
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:46,904

So you gonna buy this car?

22
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:52,309
No. Some guy named
Dirk in Denver has it.

23
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:53,510
So why go through all the effort

24
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,279
of tracking it down
if you don't want it?

25
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:56,680
Nostalgia?

26
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,515

those were one and the same.

30
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,025
She still writes me
from prison.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,762
I think my math teacher
had a crush on my me, too.

32
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:14,431
I mean, why else would he ask me
to take a shower

33
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,166
after math team practice?

34
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,936
Oh, oh, good, everybody's here.

35
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:22,473
Uh, I would now like
to introduce my girlfriend,

Hey, everybody.

38
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,977
Hi, I'm Walden. It's nice

39
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,378
to finally meet you.
Yeah.

40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,180
Alan, uh, told me that you work

41
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:32,149
in an animal shelter
taking in strays.

42
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,651
So we have
a lot in common.

43
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,453
Yeah.

44
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:37,988

Hi.
Hi.

46
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:40,090
And we met.

47
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,492
I'm Barry, Walden's
youthful ward.

48
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,126
It's really nice
to meet all of you.

49
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:44,361
God, this place
is amazing.

50
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,029
How do you afford
the rent, Alan?

51
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,298
(laughs)

52
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,300
What's so funny?

53
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:52,669
Well, I-I don't pay rent,
per se.

54
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,071
Or per month.

55
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,573
Or per year.

56
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,742
Really? No rent?

57
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,043
How long has that
been going on?

58
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,179
Three years with Walden,
eight years with my dad.

59
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:05,949
You have been living here
for 11 years for free?

60
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,984
Yeah.

61
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,585
I have never
wanted you more.

62
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,686

00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,421
Who's my cheap daddy?

64
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,457
Would you like to see
the bedroom I don't pay for?

65
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,360
Would you like to see my boobs
I bought with a Groupon?

66
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,797
Will you let me get
my grope on?

67
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,902
Nice to meet you, Gretchen.
Make yourself at home.

68
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,770
I've got to stop
saying that.

69
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,139
So, what do you say
we hop on your plane,

70
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:31,642
head over to Denver
and at least look at this car?

71
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:33,110
You know you want to.

72
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,945
You guys just want
to go to Colorado

73
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,079

It's-It's legal?

75
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,450
They legalized marijuana
in Colorado?

You say up
to three ounces?

77

Look, we're not going to Denver
to look at a car

78
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,025
and bring home
three ounces of pot.

79
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,860
Yeah, but if we go
with you,

80
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:52,062
we can bring back
nine ounces.

81
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,764

It doesn't matter
what the role is.

102
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,983
This job leads to the next,

Win a bunch of Oscars,

107
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,294
get rich, fly around
on a private plane?

108
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,396
Oh, look, I skipped to the end!

109
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:06,665
So what kind of car
are we going to look at?

110
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,001
You can thank me later
for changing the subject.

111
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,104
It's a 1967 Mustang

112
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:14,873
with a 289 V-8,
a Holley four-barrel carb

113
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,974
and Positraction.

114
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,142
(whistles)

115
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,544
What does that mean?

116
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:21,914
I have no idea. My dad used
to say it all the time

117
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,649
when we were working on the car.

118
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:25,784
I like to think that it

119
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,186
was one of his ways
of saying, "I love you."

120
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:30,155
Another was,
"Why is Daddy's beer empty?"

121
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:31,356
I totally get it.

122
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,725
My dad's coded "I love you"
was, "Seriously?

123
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,894
You can't catch a football
one damn time?"

124
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,696
(chuckles)

125
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,266
So you worked on this
with your dad.

126
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:43,702
Apparently, there's an emotional
connection with this car.

127
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:45,037
It's a mixed emotion.

128
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,906
It took us two years
to restore it.

129
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,576
When it was finished,
it was cherry.

130
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:53,011
Of course, Cherry was also
the name of the stripper

131
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,814
that he drove off with
when he left me and my mom.

132
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,683
Wait-- so why would you
want to buy something

133
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,051
that caused you
so much pain?

134
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:01,119
I mean, that'd be like me buying
the senior prom.

135
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:05,190
It was on my 16th birthday.

136
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:08,427
I go outside the house...
and there's that car

137
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,062
sitting in the driveway.

138
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,597
No sign of my dad, though.

139
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,098
It was still the best
birthday ever.

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,634
Well, until my mom took a
baseball bat to the windshield.

141
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:18,403
You know what my dad got me
for my 16th birthday?

142
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,405
A box of condoms and a card
that said,

143
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,474
"Don't make the same mistake
I did."

144
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:25,143
He was a joker.

145
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,980
How about you, Jenny?

146
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,417

I was, I was running

Whoa, wait. Why would you
run it by Lyndsey?

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,833
makes me question even wanting
to have kids.

477
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,835
You already have kids.

478
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:34,069
(Walden laughs)

479
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,938
Papa.

480
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:38,374
Come on. I'm not your dad.

481
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:42,478
You've been a better dad
to me than anybody ever has.

482
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,613
You-you-you took me in,

483
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:48,284
you inspired me to be
a better person.

484
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:51,587
You pushed me to be
a dead junkie.

485
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,790
I really want that for you, too.

486
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,759
She's right, man.
You're a role model.

487
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,093
I mean, you believe that

488
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,895
I can make something
out of myself

489
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,630
and you stopped me
from going to prison

490
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:03,399
for teaching my son
how to masturbate.

491
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:07,336
That's right.
You want to be a hands-on dad,

492
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,638
but not too hands-on.

493
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,809
Hey, bring it in, kiddos.

494

Oh, Dad?
Hmm?

497

Barry's got his hand
on my butt again.

498
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,387
It's not my hand.
Okay.

499
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:26,789
All right.

Hey, Gretchie.

I don't want to talk

Are you sure, Jeff?

510
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:53,048
Some things
are better left unsaid.

511

I love you so much,

Maybe this will help.

Okay, I appreciate the gesture,

516
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,161
but looking for change together
isn't gonna work this time.

You should be
