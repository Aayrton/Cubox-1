It will add a "copy" of the repository on your own repositories.

* Then clone the branch development on your machine :

 `git clone -b development git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`

### Run npm install
to install dependencies:

    npm install

### Forking the project

run the sql files in the /schema/* directory to generate the schema of your database. 
### Edit core/conf/index.js

In the conf.personal javascript object, you set the values of your mysql configuration, and the server port.




### Sending your pull request

Push your modifications on the fork you created, don't forget to push on **development** branch

Then pull request your modifications, there's a button for it on your fork's page (don't forget to be on the right branch, **development**)

Thanks !
